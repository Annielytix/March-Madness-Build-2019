# March-Madness-2017
Kaggle Competition for Predicting NCAA Basketball Tourney Games. [Link](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/Applying-Machine-Learning-to-March-Madness) to the associated blog post I wrote. 

* **March Madness 2017.ipynb** - File with all the main data anaylsis and machine learning models. 
* **Machine Learning and Data Analysis.ipynb** - More for experimental models and a couple more data visualizations. 
* **Predictions for 2017 Bracket.ipynb** - Shows you how to create the prediction CSV file in a format that is suitable for Kaggle. 
* **Applying Deep Learning.ipynb** - Tried deep learning models (TLDR: They didn't really work)
